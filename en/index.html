            <h3>🛈 General Information:</h3>
            <p>
                Welcome to the unofficial site of l’Evariste, a mathematics excellence competition organized by the Albert School.
Its name refers to the mathematics prodigy Évariste Galois, one of the greatest mathematicians of the 19th century, famous for his formidable intuition and reckless impetuosity.
<br><br>
It is a competition open to all high school students, and the first edition will be held on Saturday, February 3, 2024, at the Albert School premises (Paris - 10th arrondissement campus).
<br><br>
To participate, you must form a team of four people, including at least one girl.
You will find the registration details in the following section.
<br><br>
<strong>The competition consists of two written tests:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A solo test in the morning from 10:00 to 12:00.</li>
<li>A group test of four in the afternoon from 13:00 to 17:00.</li>
</ul>
In the sections below, you will find all the important information you are looking for.

<em>For the afternoon test:</em>
<ul>
<li>€1000 will be awarded to the first place team.</li>
<li>€600 will be awarded to the second place team.</li>

            <p class="citation">
                “I dream of a day when selfishness will no longer reign in science, 
when people will collaborate to study, instead of sending sealed envelopes to academicians, 
they will hasten to publish their smallest new observations, 
and will add ‘I don't know the rest.’”
